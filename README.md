# ikea-smartlight
python framework for controlling the Ikea smart lights (tardfri)

## requirements
at this moment there is no coap libs with dTLS, the ikea smart lights are using dTLS with coap for security. the only option is to build a new libcoap with dTLS included.

### libcoap

    - cunit
    - a2x
    - doxygen

### smartlight.py

    - coap-client

## code will follow soon
